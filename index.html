<P>My Name is Yirim (yiddim) Seck work as a hip-hop and visual artist is inspired by exploring the links between arts and sustainability, how artists support other artists in the way of collaborations and contractual services.  The discussion in my works is largely centered around artists who are creating alternative incomes in order to further invest in their respected mediums, moving towards becoming  living artists and sustaining fully off of their art.  I am a Hip-Hop artist and activist of 19 years with a background in the construction trades and  social justice, specifically in the green energy sector. Last year I began the process of launching my own contracting company, with the idea of creating a business that  serves as a means of supporting my family and community while creating a revenue stream that would allow me to invest in my art, pushing the boundaries of my creativity.</P>

<p>I am a wordsmith MC whose music both reflects the golden era of hip-hop and holds a roadmap to the future.
