<P>I am tradesman who began his journey doing home weatherization and green energy retrofitting through a company called Got Green.  Yirim completed the program, became certified in retrofitting homes for energy efficiency, joined local 242 labor union and increasingly became recognized as one of the few local success stories emerging from President Obama’s 2008 green energy initiative.  He feels that through a progressive merging of art and activism he can help people on both sides of the ‘green gap’ traverse the barriers that separate them.  Yirim has been committed to not only making great music, but using music and performance as a platform for ‘green activism’ and alliance building across the diverse sectors of our society.
    
    Over the past 9 years Yirim Seck has been working to strategically develop a stronger civic and social media presence and explore new ways to have a positive and enduring impact on the community.</P>
